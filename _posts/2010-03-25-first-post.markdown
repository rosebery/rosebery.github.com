It was nice learning about [github pages](http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages) and [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  I'm still not quite done, but at least we have the basics for now. The [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) language seems to be a very logical way for writing posts. More to come soon :-)
